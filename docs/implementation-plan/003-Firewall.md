Mission 3: Implementing and Testing the 'Firewall' Feature with Check & Diff Modes
Mission Number: 3

Mission Title: Implementing and Testing the 'Firewall' Feature with Check & Diff Modes

Mission Description: The module will be enhanced to manage a list of firewall rules for a given environment. This mission introduces more complex parameter handling (type: list) and focuses on implementing two critical Ansible features for user trust and safety: Check Mode and Diff Mode.

Mission Plan:

1. Handling Complex Parameters

Managing a list of firewall rules requires handling a more complex data structure than a simple string. The module must be able to accept a list of dictionaries and compare it against the current state.

Update Documentation for firewall_rules:
Add the new firewall_rules parameter to the DOCUMENTATION block in cloud_manager.py. This parameter will be of type: 'list' with elements: 'dict', and its sub-options must also be documented.   

YAML
#... inside DOCUMENTATION options...
    firewall_rules:
        description:
            - A list of firewall rules to apply to the environment.
            - Any rules not in this list will be removed.
        type: list
        elements: dict
        suboptions:
            protocol:
                description: The network protocol.
                type: str
                choices: [ tcp, udp ]
                required: true
            port:
                description: The port number.
                type: int
                required: true
Update the Argument Specification:
The argument_spec in main() must be updated to match the new documentation.

Python
#... inside main() argument_spec...
'firewall_rules': dict(type='list', elements='dict', options=dict(
    protocol=dict(type='str', required=True, choices=['tcp', 'udp']),
    port=dict(type='int', required=True),
)),
Implement the Comparison Logic:
To determine if a change is needed, the module must compare the list of rules provided by the user with the "current" list on the target. A naive comparison of lists can fail if the order is different. A robust approach is to normalize both lists (e.g., by sorting them) before comparison.

Add a helper function to cloud_manager.py:

Python
def _normalize_rules(rules):
    """Sorts a list of rule dictionaries to allow for consistent comparison."""
    if not rules:
        return
    # Sort by a tuple of values to ensure a deterministic order
    return sorted(rules, key=lambda r: (r['protocol'], r['port']))
Modify the main() function to use this logic when the firewall_rules parameter is provided.

2. Implementing Check Mode (--check)

Check mode is a contract with the user: when enabled, the module promises to report what it would do without making any actual changes. This is a critical feature for safety and predictability.   

The AnsibleModule instantiation in Mission 1 already included supports_check_mode=True.

The logic must be structured to separate "read/compare" operations from "write" operations. The if not module.check_mode: guard is the key to this separation. When module.check_mode is True, the module performs its checks, determines if a change is needed, sets result['changed'], but skips the block of code that would modify the system state.   

3. Implementing Diff Mode (--diff)

Diff mode provides invaluable transparency by showing the user exactly what will be changed. To support this, the module must construct a    

diff object and include it in its return data when a change occurs.

The diff object should contain before and after keys. The value of before is the state of the resource prior to the change, and after is the desired state.   

This diff dictionary is then passed into the module.exit_json() call. Ansible's callback plugins will automatically format and display this information to the user if the --diff flag is used.

The updated main() function incorporating firewall logic, check mode, and diff mode is as follows (this replaces the main from Mission 2):

Python
def main():
    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=dict(
            name=dict(type='str', required=True),
            state=dict(type='str', default='present', choices=['present', 'absent']),
            firewall_rules=dict(type='list', elements='dict', options=dict(
                protocol=dict(type='str', required=True, choices=['tcp', 'udp']),
                port=dict(type='int', required=True),
            ), default=None),
        ),
        supports_check_mode=True
    )

    name = module.params['name']
    state = module.params['state']
    desired_rules = module.params['firewall_rules']

    result = dict(changed=False, name=name, state=state)

    # --- Environment State Management (from Mission 2) ---
    current_env = get_environment(name)
    if state == 'present' and current_env is None:
        if not module.check_mode:
            create_environment(name)
        result['changed'] = True
    elif state == 'absent' and current_env is not None:
        if not module.check_mode:
            delete_environment(name)
        result['changed'] = True
        module.exit_json(**result) # Exit early if deleting

    # If we are ensuring presence, check firewall rules
    if state == 'present' and desired_rules is not None:
        # In a real module, this would be another API call
        current_rules = current_env.get('rules',)

        # Normalize for comparison
        norm_current = _normalize_rules(current_rules)
        norm_desired = _normalize_rules(desired_rules)

        if norm_current!= norm_desired:
            result['changed'] = True
            result['diff'] = {
                'before': '\n'.join([f"{r['protocol']}:{r['port']}" for r in norm_current]),
                'after': '\n'.join([f"{r['protocol']}:{r['port']}" for r in norm_desired]),
            }
            if not module.check_mode:
                # In a real module, this would be an API call to set the rules
                print(f"SIMULATING: Setting firewall rules for '{name}'")
                current_env['rules'] = desired_rules

    module.exit_json(**result)
4. Advanced Integration Testing for Check & Diff

A new integration test is required to validate this more complex behavior. The test must confirm that check mode prevents changes and that diff mode reports correctly.

Create the new integration test target:

Bash
mkdir -p tests/integration/targets/cloud_manager_firewall/tasks
Write the test playbook:
Populate tests/integration/targets/cloud_manager_firewall/tasks/main.yml with the following test case. This pattern explicitly verifies the contract of check mode.

YAML
# tests/integration/targets/cloud_manager_firewall/tasks/main.yml
- name: Ensure a test environment exists without any rules
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: firewall-test-env
    state: present
    firewall_rules:

- name: 1. Run in CHECK mode to add a rule
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: firewall-test-env
    state: present
    firewall_rules:
      - { protocol: tcp, port: 443 }
  register: result_check
  check_mode: true # Force check_mode for this task

- name: Assert that check mode reported a change and a diff
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - result_check.changed
      - result_check.diff is defined
      - "'tcp:443' in result_check.diff.after"

- name: 2. Verify NO change was actually made
  # This is a simulated check. A real test might use a command or another module.
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: firewall-test-env
    state: present
  register: result_verify_no_change

- name: Assert that the rule list is still empty
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - result_verify_no_change.diff is not defined

- name: 3. Run for REAL to add the rule
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: firewall-test-env
    state: present
    firewall_rules:
      - { protocol: tcp, port: 443 }
  register: result_real

- name: Assert that the real run reported a change
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - result_real.changed

- name: 4. Run again in CHECK mode (idempotency check)
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: firewall-test-env
    state: present
    firewall_rules:
      - { protocol: tcp, port: 443 }
  register: result_check_idempotent
  check_mode: true

- name: Assert that check mode now reports NO change
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - not result_check_idempotent.changed
5. The Development Workflow

Finalize the mission by committing the code, running the tests, and updating all relevant documentation.

Commit the feature:

Bash
git add plugins/modules/cloud_manager.py tests/integration/targets/cloud_manager_firewall/
git commit -m "feat(firewall): Add firewall rule management with check and diff support"
Run the tests:

Bash
ansible-test integration --docker cloud_manager_firewall
Update documentation:
Thoroughly update the DOCUMENTATION, EXAMPLES, and RETURN blocks in cloud_manager.py. It is critical to document the structure of the firewall_rules list and its sub-options, as well as the structure of the diff object in the RETURN block.

Commit documentation updates:

Bash
git add plugins/modules/cloud_manager.py
git commit -m "docs(firewall): Document firewall_rules parameter and diff return value"
Mission Status: Complete

Mission Notes: A module that correctly implements check and diff modes is significantly more trustworthy and user-friendly. Check mode provides a safety net, allowing users to validate their playbooks before execution. Diff mode provides transparency, showing exactly what will change, which is invaluable for complex resources like firewall rule sets. Mastering these features is a key step toward writing enterprise-grade Ansible modules.

The module now supports complex parameters and provides essential safety and visibility features. The next step is to handle even more complex objects and implement robust error handling.
