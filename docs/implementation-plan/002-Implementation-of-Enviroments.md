Mission 2: Implementing and Testing the 'Environments' Feature
Mission Number: 2

Mission Title: Implementing and Testing the 'Environments' Feature

Mission Description: The first core feature of the cloud_manager module will now be implemented: creating and deleting named "environments." This mission is crucial as it introduces the fundamental Ansible concepts of state management (present, absent), idempotency, and the changed status. Both unit and integration tests will be written to validate this behavior.

Mission Plan:

1. Implementing the Feature Logic

The first step is to define the module's interface in its documentation and then implement the corresponding logic.

Update Module Documentation:
The DOCUMENTATION block in plugins/modules/cloud_manager.py is the module's public contract. It must be updated to describe the new parameters: name for the environment's name and state to define the desired state. Proper documentation is essential for usability.   

YAML
#... inside DOCUMENTATION...
options:
    name:
        description:
            - The name of the cloud environment to manage.
        type: str
        required: true
    state:
        description:
            - The desired state of the environment.
        type: str
        default: present
        choices:
            - present
            - absent
Define the Argument Specification:
The argument_spec dictionary within the AnsibleModule instantiation validates the parameters passed by the user. It must mirror the DOCUMENTATION block to ensure consistency.   

Python
#... inside main()...
module = AnsibleModule(
    argument_spec=dict(
        name=dict(type='str', required=True),
        state=dict(type='str', default='present', choices=['present', 'absent'])
    ),
    supports_check_mode=True
)
Write the Core Python Logic:
The module's logic must first determine the current state of the resource before deciding whether to act. This is the core principle of declarative automation. For this guide, a placeholder function will simulate interaction with a cloud API.

Add these helper functions inside cloud_manager.py before the main() function:

Python
# This is a mock database to simulate the state of the cloud.
# In a real module, this data would come from an API call.
_CLOUD_ENVIRONMENTS = {
    'production': {'id': 'env-123', 'status': 'active'},
}

def get_environment(name):
    """Simulates fetching an environment from the cloud API."""
    return _CLOUD_ENVIRONMENTS.get(name)

def create_environment(name):
    """Simulates creating a new environment."""
    print(f"SIMULATING: Creating environment '{name}'")
    _CLOUD_ENVIRONMENTS[name] = {'id': f'env-{hash(name)}', 'status': 'active'}

def delete_environment(name):
    """Simulates deleting an environment."""
    print(f"SIMULATING: Deleting environment '{name}'")
    if name in _CLOUD_ENVIRONMENTS:
        del _CLOUD_ENVIRONMENTS[name]
Implement Idempotent State Management:
The main() function will now use these helpers to implement the four key scenarios of state management. The concept of idempotency—where an operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application—is not automatic. It must be explicitly coded by comparing the desired state with the current state.   

Replace the existing main() function with this implementation:

Python
def main():
    """Main execution path of the module."""
    module = AnsibleModule(
        argument_spec=dict(
            name=dict(type='str', required=True),
            state=dict(type='str', default='present', choices=['present', 'absent'])
        ),
        supports_check_mode=True
    )

    name = module.params['name']
    state = module.params['state']

    # The result dictionary will be populated based on actions taken.
    result = dict(
        changed=False,
        name=name,
        state=state
    )

    current_env = get_environment(name)

    if state == 'present':
        if current_env is None:
            # Environment does not exist, so it needs to be created.
            if not module.check_mode:
                create_environment(name)
            result['changed'] = True
            result['msg'] = f"Environment '{name}' created successfully."
        else:
            # Environment already exists, no action needed. This is idempotency.
            result['msg'] = f"Environment '{name}' already exists."

    elif state == 'absent':
        if current_env is not None:
            # Environment exists, so it needs to be deleted.
            if not module.check_mode:
                delete_environment(name)
            result['changed'] = True
            result['msg'] = f"Environment '{name}' deleted successfully."
        else:
            # Environment is already absent, no action needed. This is idempotency.
            result['msg'] = f"Environment '{name}' is already absent."

    module.exit_json(**result)
Notice the if not module.check_mode: guards. These prevent the "write" operations (create_environment, delete_environment) from running during a dry run, a concept that will be fully explored in Mission 3.

2. Unit Testing the Idempotent Logic

Unit tests are essential for validating the internal logic of the module in isolation, without the overhead of running a full playbook. Here, mocking is a critical technique. It allows for replacing parts of the code, like the API helper functions, with controlled substitutes.   

Update tests/units/plugins/modules/test_cloud_manager.py with the following tests. These use pytest fixtures and the unittest.mock.patch decorator to control the return value of get_environment.

Python
# tests/units/plugins/modules/test_cloud_manager.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock

#... (keep the existing import statements)...

# Helper to run the module's main() function and catch its exit
def run_module(module_args, mock_get_env):
    with patch.object(cloud_manager, 'get_environment', mock_get_env):
        with patch.object(cloud_manager, 'create_environment') as mock_create:
            with patch.object(cloud_manager, 'delete_environment') as mock_delete:
                # Mock AnsibleModule and its methods
                mock_module = MagicMock()
                mock_module.params = module_args
                mock_module.check_mode = False

                # Store exit_json args for assertion
                exit_json_args = {}
                def fake_exit_json(**kwargs):
                    exit_json_args.update(kwargs)
                mock_module.exit_json.side_effect = fake_exit_json

                with patch('ansible.module_utils.basic.AnsibleModule', return_value=mock_module):
                    cloud_manager.main()

                return exit_json_args, mock_create, mock_delete

def test_env_present_when_absent():
    """Test creating an environment that does not exist."""
    args = {'name': 'staging', 'state': 'present'}
    # Simulate that the environment does not exist
    mock_get_env = MagicMock(return_value=None)

    result, mock_create, _ = run_module(args, mock_get_env)

    assert result['changed'] is True
    mock_create.assert_called_once_with('staging')

def test_env_present_when_present():
    """Test creating an environment that already exists (idempotency)."""
    args = {'name': 'production', 'state': 'present'}
    # Simulate that the environment already exists
    mock_get_env = MagicMock(return_value={'id': 'env-123'})

    result, mock_create, mock_delete = run_module(args, mock_get_env)

    assert result['changed'] is False
    mock_create.assert_not_called()
    mock_delete.assert_not_called()

def test_env_absent_when_present():
    """Test deleting an environment that exists."""
    args = {'name': 'production', 'state': 'absent'}
    # Simulate that the environment exists
    mock_get_env = MagicMock(return_value={'id': 'env-123'})

    result, _, mock_delete = run_module(args, mock_get_env)

    assert result['changed'] is True
    mock_delete.assert_called_once_with('production')

def test_env_absent_when_absent():
    """Test deleting an environment that does not exist (idempotency)."""
    args = {'name': 'staging', 'state': 'absent'}
    # Simulate that the environment does not exist
    mock_get_env = MagicMock(return_value=None)

    result, mock_create, mock_delete = run_module(args, mock_get_env)

    assert result['changed'] is False
    mock_create.assert_not_called()
    mock_delete.assert_not_called()
These tests precisely validate each logical path of the main function, ensuring the changed status is correct and that actions are only taken when necessary.

3. Introduction to Integration Testing

While unit tests are excellent for internal logic, they do not prove the module works correctly when invoked by the Ansible engine. Integration tests fill this gap by running the module within a real playbook, confirming its external contract—argument parsing, return value structure, and behavior—is correct from a user's perspective.   

Create the integration test target:
A "target" is an Ansible role located under tests/integration/targets/ that contains the test playbook.   

Bash
mkdir -p tests/integration/targets/cloud_manager_env/tasks
Create the test playbook:
The test logic resides in tests/integration/targets/cloud_manager_env/tasks/main.yml.

4. The Idempotency Test Pattern

A robust integration test for idempotency follows a specific, multi-step pattern that verifies the module's behavior on initial and subsequent runs.   

Populate main.yml with the following tasks:

YAML
# tests/integration/targets/cloud_manager_env/tasks/main.yml
- name: 1. Create a new environment 'testing'
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: testing
    state: present
  register: result_create

- name: Assert that the environment was created
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - result_create.changed

- name: 2. Run the create task again (idempotency check)
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: testing
    state: present
  register: result_idempotent_create

- name: Assert that no change occurred on the second run
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - not result_idempotent_create.changed

- name: 3. Delete the environment 'testing'
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: testing
    state: absent
  register: result_delete

- name: Assert that the environment was deleted
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - result_delete.changed

- name: 4. Run the delete task again (idempotency check)
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: testing
    state: absent
  register: result_idempotent_delete

- name: Assert that no change occurred on the second delete run
  ansible.builtin.assert:
    that:
      - not result_idempotent_delete.changed
This sequence is the gold standard for proving idempotency in an integration test. It explicitly checks that changed is true only when a change is actually made.

5. The Development Workflow

Now, commit the changes and run the full test suite.

Commit the feature:

Bash
git add plugins/modules/cloud_manager.py tests/
git commit -m "feat(env): Implement state management for environments"
Run all tests:
Execute both the unit and new integration tests.

Bash
ansible-test units --docker
ansible-test integration --docker cloud_manager_env
Both commands should report that all tests passed.

Update documentation:
A feature is not complete until it is documented. Update the EXAMPLES block in cloud_manager.py with a clear, copy-paste-ready example. Also, update the main    

README.md to mention the new capability.

YAML
#... inside EXAMPLES block in cloud_manager.py...
- name: Ensure the 'staging' environment exists
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: staging
    state: present

- name: Ensure the 'dev' environment is removed
  my_cloud.manager.cloud_manager:
    name: dev
    state: absent
Commit documentation updates:

Bash
git add plugins/modules/cloud_manager.py README.md
git commit -m "docs(env): Add examples and update README for environment feature"
Mission Status: Complete

Mission Notes: This mission covered the most critical concept in Ansible module development: idempotency. By implementing and validating this principle with both unit and integration tests, the cloud_manager module now behaves in the predictable, declarative manner that Ansible users expect. The dual-validation strategy of using unit tests for internal logic and integration tests for the external contract is a professional pattern that ensures high quality.

Common Module Documentation Macros

To create high-quality, readable documentation that integrates well with ansible-doc, developers should use standard semantic markup macros.
