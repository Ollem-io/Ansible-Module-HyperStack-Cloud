# Mission 006: Local CI Testing with AMD64 Enforcement

## Mission Title
Add Make Command for Local CI Testing with AMD64 Processor Enforcement

## Mission Description
Create a make command that allows developers to run the CI pipeline locally with enforced AMD64 processor architecture. This will enable testing CI workflows on local machines before pushing changes to the repository.

## Mission Plan

1. **Analyze Current CI Workflow**
   - Review the existing `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file
   - Identify all CI steps that need to be replicated locally
   - Document any GitHub Actions-specific features that need adaptation

2. **Create Makefile**
   - Add a new Makefile or update existing one
   - Create `ci-local` target that runs all CI steps
   - Enforce AMD64 architecture for Docker containers or processes
   - Ensure Python and Ansible versions match CI configuration

3. **Implement Local CI Command**
   - Set up environment variables matching CI
   - Run linting, testing, and validation steps
   - Handle platform-specific requirements for AMD64 enforcement
   - Provide clear output and error reporting

4. **Test and Document**
   - Test the make command on local machine
   - Verify AMD64 enforcement is working correctly
   - Add usage instructions to documentation

## Mission Status
- [ ] In Progress

## Mission Notes
- CI uses specific Python and Ansible versions that must be matched locally
- AMD64 enforcement may require Docker with platform specification or emulation
- Need to ensure all CI environment variables are properly set
