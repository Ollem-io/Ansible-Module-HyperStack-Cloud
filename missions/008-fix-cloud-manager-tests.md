# Mission 008: Fix Cloud Manager Tests

## Mission Number
008

## Mission Title
Fix Cloud Manager Unit Tests and Increase Coverage

## Mission Description
The cloud_manager.py unit tests are failing due to stdin reading issues when AnsibleModule is initialized. Additionally, test coverage is at 19% which is below the required 80% threshold.

## Mission Plan
1. Fix the stdin reading issue by properly mocking AnsibleModule initialization
2. Update all test cases to use the fixed mocking approach
3. Add additional test cases to increase coverage to 80%+
4. Ensure all tests pass successfully
5. Verify coverage meets requirements

## Mission Status
Completed

## Mission Notes
- Primary issue: AnsibleModule reads from stdin during initialization which conflicts with pytest
- Need to mock the entire AnsibleModule class and prevent stdin reading
- Initial coverage: 19%, Final coverage: 87% (exceeds 80% target)
- Fixed 11 failing tests that were previously broken due to stdin issues
- Added additional test cases to increase coverage:
  - Check mode functionality
  - VM state management (stopped VMs)
  - VM idempotency checks
  - Format rules for display function
  - Multiple VM management
  - Environment with existing firewall rules
  - VM creation in new environments
- All 20 tests now pass successfully
