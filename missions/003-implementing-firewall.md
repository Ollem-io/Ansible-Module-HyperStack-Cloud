# Mission 003: Implementing and Testing the 'Firewall' Feature with Check & Diff Modes

## Mission Number
003

## Mission Title
Implementing and Testing the 'Firewall' Feature with Check & Diff Modes

## Mission Description
The module will be enhanced to manage a list of firewall rules for a given environment. This mission introduces more complex parameter handling (type: list) and focuses on implementing two critical Ansible features for user trust and safety: Check Mode and Diff Mode.

## Mission Plan

### 1. Handling Complex Parameters
- **Update Documentation**: Add the new `firewall_rules` parameter to the DOCUMENTATION block in cloud_manager.py
  - Parameter type: `list` with elements: `dict`
  - Sub-options: `protocol` (tcp/udp) and `port` (int)
  
- **Update Argument Specification**: Modify the `argument_spec` in `main()` to match the new documentation

- **Implement Comparison Logic**: Create a `_normalize_rules()` helper function to enable proper comparison of firewall rules lists

### 2. Implementing Check Mode (--check)
- Leverage the existing `supports_check_mode=True` configuration
- Structure code to separate read/compare operations from write operations
- Use `if not module.check_mode:` guard to prevent actual changes during check mode

### 3. Implementing Diff Mode (--diff)  
- Construct a diff object with `before` and `after` keys when changes occur
- Include the diff in the module's return data
- Format rules in a human-readable way for the diff output

### 4. Update Main Function
- Integrate environment state management from Mission 2
- Add firewall rules management logic
- Implement proper check mode and diff mode support throughout

### 5. Advanced Integration Testing
- Create new test target: `cloud_manager_firewall`
- Write comprehensive tests that:
  - Verify check mode prevents actual changes
  - Confirm diff mode reports correctly
  - Test idempotency with firewall rules
  - Validate rule normalization logic

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Update DOCUMENTATION block with firewall_rules parameter details
- Add comprehensive EXAMPLES showing firewall rule management
- Update RETURN block to document the diff structure

## Mission Status
Pending

## Mission Notes
- Check mode provides a safety net for users to validate their playbooks before execution
- Diff mode provides transparency by showing exactly what will change
- Proper normalization of firewall rules ensures consistent comparison regardless of rule order
- This implementation will serve as a foundation for handling more complex data structures in future missions
